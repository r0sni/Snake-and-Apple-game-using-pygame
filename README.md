## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake and Apple game, where players control a snake that grows longer as it eats apples. The goal is to avoid collisions with the walls and with the snake's own body. The game becomes more challenging as the snake grows.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive gameplay.
- Snake movement using [arrow keys/WASD keys].
- Apples that appear randomly on the screen for the snake to eat.
- Snake grows longer every time it eats an apple.
- Game over when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- Score tracking to keep track of the player's performance.

## How to Play

1. Use the [arrow keys/WASD keys] to control the snake's direction.
2. Navigate the snake to the apples to make it eat them.
3. Each time the snake eats an apple, it will grow longer.
4. Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.
5. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
6. Try to achieve the highest score possible before the game ends.
